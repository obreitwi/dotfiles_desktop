# Additional dotfiles I need in a desktop enviroment

On a desktop computer you have to configure more applications than in a remote
environment you ssh-into (for the latter, see my
[toolbox](http://github.com/obreitwi/toolbox)). These additional configuration
files are gathered in this repository. They include configurations for various
tools, notably [xmonad](http://xmonad.org) and some X11-scripts to setup xmonad
as the sole desktop environment I use.

Some configuration files have a `.pydemx`-extension, indicating that they are
customized on each host via [PyDeMX](http://github.com/obreitwi/pydemx).
